# Flight-Price-Prediction-Datascience-Project
The Flight Price Prediction Project is a machine learning-based project that predicts the cost of a flight based on the user's desired travel details. The project uses a variety of features, such as the source airport, destination airport, date of journey, and number of stops, to train a model that can predict the future price of a flight.
